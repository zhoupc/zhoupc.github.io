I am a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University, where I work with [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/). Previously, I was a graduate student working with [Robert Kass](www.stat.cmu.edu/~kass) at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](www.cmu.edu). Before that, I was an undergraduate majoying physics at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/), where I was introduced to neuroscience research in [Guoqiang Bi](http://en.hfnl.ustc.edu.cn/Faculty/Facultys/201107/t20110716_116204.html)'s lab. 

My research lies at the intersection of computational neuroscience and machine learning, focusing on the applications of quantitative approaches to the study of the brain. My current project is to develop new methods for analyzing large-scale multi neuronal recordings, with an emphasis on calcium imaging data.  

I love creating tools for making life easier!
