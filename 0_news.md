#### :video_camera: 2020-06-30 Virtual talk at Chinese Computation and Cognitive Neuroscience 2020 ([CCCN2020](http://meeting.cns.org.cn/2020CCCNCE/))
Title: **Fusing electron microscopy data and calcium imaging data to achieve functional connectomics**


#### :orange_book:  2020-6-10 New paper published on ***Neurons, Behavior, Data Analysis and Theory (NBDT)***

Our preprint "[EASE: EM-Assisted Source Extraction from calcium imaging data
](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.007468v1.abstract)" was on bioRxiv. Our computational method on fusing calcium imaging data and electron microscopy data was described  in this preprint. The code was on [Github](https://github.com/zhoupc/ease).
