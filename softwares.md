#### CNMF_E 

Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for microEndoscopic data. 'E' also suggests 'extension'. It is build on top of [CNMF](https://github.com/epnev/ca_source_extraction) with supports to 1 photon data. [**GitHub**](https://github.com/zhoupc/CNMF_E); [**Slack**](beat-ica.slack.com)


#### OASIS 

Fast online deconvolution of calcium imaging. The package was initially developed to run OASIS algorithms for fast spike inference. Later I integrated other deconvolution algorithms as well and run deconvolution using a unified function *deconvolveCa*. The users can easily try different algorithms by properly setting the options.
